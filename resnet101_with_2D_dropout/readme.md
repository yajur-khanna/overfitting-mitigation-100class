## 🔹 F1 Score

- Training F1 Score: Climbs to ~0.92, following a similar trajectory to accuracy.
- Validation F1 Score: Peaks around ~0.72 near epoch 13–15, then gradually settles to ~0.68–0.71 with oscillations.

## 🔹 Loss Curve

- Training Loss: Decreases steadily to ~0.15 by epoch 50.
- Validation Loss: Drops initially to ~1.0 by epoch 15 but then slightly increases and stabilizes around ~1.1–1.4, indicating early signs of overfitting.

## Observation

After adding dropouts near the end of the ResNet model layers, overfitting is reduced minimally but the model generalisability was also affected slightly.
